ETE388 is an advanced levels course that Linkoping University offers which I am taking during the summer of 2025. My solutions will be written in c++ as this is the standard language for competitive programming, enabling high performance solutions.

*"The goal of the course is to develop the ability to solve algorithmic problems by utilizing knowledge of algorithms, data structures and complexity theory with a focus on search and dynamic programming. To solve this type of problem, 
it is important to be able to analyze the problem, choose or design an algorithm, determine how much resources (time and memory) the algorithm requires, and to implement and test the algorithm quickly and correctly."*
